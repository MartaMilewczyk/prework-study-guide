Personal target of this project was to start my own learning journey in IT industry. Project was build to walk through my first app development path - simple app with HTML, CSS and Javascript. Building this project allowed me to learn how to work with Git and Github. Performing several times commands in CLI learned me Git flow - how to add, commit and push my work to the feature branch and then making pull request and merge to the main branch. Few times done, such iterations serve as a starting point to develop habit to frequently sync the local version of code with the remote version in GitHub.
